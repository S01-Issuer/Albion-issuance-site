# Future Releases Refactoring Summary

## Overview
Successfully refactored hardcoded future releases data from `DataStoreService.ts` into a separate mock data file with proper TypeScript typing. This change improves maintainability and sets up the foundation for future backend integration.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created New Type Definitions
- **File**: `src/lib/types/MetaboardTypes.ts`
- **Added Types**:
  - `FutureRelease`: Interface for individual future release data
  - `FutureReleaseData`: Interface for the complete future releases data structure

```typescript
export interface FutureRelease {
  whenRelease: string;
  description: string;
  emoji?: string;
}

export interface FutureReleaseData {
  [assetId: string]: {
    [tokenId: string]: FutureRelease[];
  };
}
```

### 2. Created Mock Data File
- **File**: `src/lib/data/futureReleases.json`
- **Structure**: Organized by asset ID, then token ID, containing arrays of future releases
- **Contains**: All previously hardcoded future release data:
  - Europa Wressle (eur_wr4) - Q2 2025
  - Bakken Horizon (bak_hf3) - Q3 2025  
  - Permian Basin (per_bv2) - Q4 2025
  - Gulf of Mexico (gom_dw2) - Q1 2026

### 3. Updated DataStoreService
- **File**: `src/lib/services/DataStoreService.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Added import for `FutureReleaseData` type
  - Added import for `futureReleases.json` data
  - Removed hardcoded future release arrays (`eurWr4Future`, `bakHf3Future`, etc.)
  - Added private property `futureReleases: FutureReleaseData`
  - Updated constructor to initialize future releases from JSON data
  - Refactored `getFutureReleases()` method to use the new data structure

### 4. Improved Code Structure
- **Before**: Hardcoded arrays scattered in the service file
- **After**: Centralized data file with proper typing and structured access
- **Benefits**:
  - Better separation of concerns
  - Easier to maintain and update release data
  - Type safety with TypeScript interfaces
  - Prepared for future backend integration

## Migration Path
The refactoring maintains full backward compatibility. All existing methods (`getFutureReleases()`, `getFutureReleasesByAsset()`, `getNextRelease()`, etc.) continue to work exactly as before, but now use the structured data file instead of hardcoded arrays.

## Future Enhancements
- The `FutureReleaseData` structure supports multiple releases per token
- Easy to add new assets and tokens
- Structure supports additional metadata (emoji, extended descriptions)
- Ready for backend API integration when available

## Verification
- TypeScript compilation passes with no new errors
- All future release methods maintain their existing API contracts
- Data structure properly typed and validated
