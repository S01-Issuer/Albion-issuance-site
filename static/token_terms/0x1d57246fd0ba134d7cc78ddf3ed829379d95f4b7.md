## 3. Ordering and Delivery of Royalty Tokens

1. Anyone wishing to acquire Royalty Tokens requires a Wallet that is compatible with the Blockchain. Issuer cannot accept orders without specifying a Blockchain address in the online subscription process. A smartphone or a computer with internet access is necessary to create a Wallet.
2. Royalty Tokens are acquired through individual token series referred to as Royalty Token Releases, each representing a specific economic entitlement to a portion of Total Distributions funded by underlying Revenue Payments. Each Royalty Token Release is assigned to a distinct SFT Bucket and sequentially numbered (e.g., "Royalty Token Release 0," "Royalty Token Release 1" etc.).
3. Royalty Tokens may be subscribed for as part of specific Royalty Token Releases by submitting a purchase application to Issuer via the designated Interface. Investor must specify the intended subscription amount, provide a compatible Blockchain Wallet address and pay the applicable Royalty Token Price before the Royalty Tokens are transferred.
4. The economic parameters applicable to each Royalty Token Release, including the underlying asset, Royalty Interest, Royalty Payment Percentage, Royalty Token Price, Supply Type, Supply Limit, and, if applicable, Management Fees, are set out in the Particulars table for each Release. These Particulars are made available to Investors via the system Interface.
5. Each Royalty Token Release is a type of Royalty Token, either:
   1. a Fixed Royalty Token; or
   2. a Variable Royalty Token.
6. Royalty Tokens are transferred to Investor after full payment of the Royalty Token Price to the Wallet address provided by Investor. Payment must be made in the currency specified in the applicable Particulars for that Royalty Token Release.
7. Issuance of Royalty Tokens is permitted only for Investors who have successfully completed the onboarding process and are considered Greenlisted by Issuer.

## 4. Distributions and Calculation

1. Royalty Provider receives periodic Royalty Payments from Royalty Originator under the applicable Revenue Swap Agreement. Pursuant to the Revenue Purchase Agreement between Royalty Provider and Issuer, Issuer may acquire royalty interests from Royalty Provider. To the extent such royalty interests have been acquired, the portion of such Royalty Payments that corresponds to Distributions to which Investors are entitled under these Token Terms is acquired by Issuer from Royalty Provider as Revenue Payments for further processing as the aggregate Total Distributions. These Revenue Payments represent the sole source of Distributions to Investors under these Token Terms. The amount and continuity of Royalty Payments under the Revenue Swap Agreement depend on the ongoing performance of the Project Agreement, Offtake Agreement, Government Licence and the production capacity of the Wellbore. These factors are outside the control of Issuer and Royalty Provider and only partially within the control of Royalty Originator, and may affect the volume, timing or continuation of such Royalty Payments. Accordingly, Issuer obligation to make Distributions to Investors is strictly limited to making Distributions solely out of Total Distributions that Issuer has actually acquired as Revenue Payments under the Revenue Purchase Agreement. Issuer does not assume any obligation to use its own funds or to guarantee payments not received.
2. Investors are entitled to receive pro-rata Distributions from Issuer, which reflect Revenue Payments received by Issuer under the Revenue Purchase Agreement. These Revenue Payments result from Royalty Payments made by Royalty Originator to Royalty Provider under the Revenue Swap Agreement. These Total Distributions are determined based on the Royalty Interest acquired by Issuer under the applicable Revenue Purchase Agreement and the Royalty Payment Percentage specified for the relevant Royalty Token Release. Any such Distributions shall only become due and payable by Issuer to Investors upon actual receipt of the corresponding Total Distributions as Revenue Payments from Royalty Provider.
3. To the extent that interest is payable by Royalty Originator in connection with delayed or outstanding Royalty Payments under the Revenue Swap Agreement and such amounts are acquired by Issuer as Revenue Payments under the Revenue Purchase Agreement, such interest shall be treated as part of the Total Distributions and distributed by Issuer to Investors accordingly.
4. Distributions to Investors for both Supply Types (Fixed or Variable) are calculated based on the following steps.
   1. Royalty Interest including increases or reductions (minus fees of Royalty Provider), split between Royalty Token Releases according to the Royalty Payment Percentages, to get the Total Distribution.
   2. Total Distribution divided by the quantity of Royalty Tokens minted for the applicable Royalty Token Release to get the payment per Royalty Token held by an Investor during a month, which is determined by reference to the Snapshot process described by the clause at reference 2.
5. For Fixed Royalty Tokens, Distributions are calculated as an equal share of the Total Distribution allocated to the corresponding Royalty Token Release based on the fixed number of Tokens defined as the Supply Limit in the Particulars. Each Royalty Token represents a fixed portion of the Total Distribution for that Royalty Token Release.
6. For Variable Royalty Tokens, Distributions are calculated based on the number of Royalty Tokens in circulation at the time of the Snapshots and the number of Royalty Tokens held in Investor's Wallet. Variable Royalty Tokens are minted progressively upon acquisition by Investors from Issuer until the Supply Limit specified in the Particulars is reached.
7. Where a portion of the Revenue Payment is not allocated to an active Royalty Token Release, it will be retained as Pending Distributions and distributed to Investors on a pro-rata basis in accordance with the Royalty Payment Percentage over the first twelve (12) Distribution cycles of the relevant Royalty Token Release.
8. Distributions are determined based on two blockchain Snapshots taken per calendar day by Issuer, without prior notice. These Snapshots record for each Royalty Token Release:
   1. Wallet Balance; and
   2. Release Supply.
9. For each Distribution cycle, to calculate the percentage of the Total Distribution for payment to a Wallet, Issuer will determine the average of the Wallet Balance and Release Supply between the Snapshots and use the following formula: average Wallet Balance divided by average Release Supply multiplied by 100. |Ref 2|
10. Investors must hold Royalty Tokens at the time of at least one of the Snapshots in order to be eligible for a Distribution in the relevant month. The Distribution amount is then calculated as described in the clause at reference 2. No Distributions are made to a Wallet if the Token is not held by a Wallet in either Snapshot. |Ref 3|
11. In the event that Royalty Payments under the Revenue Swap Agreement are temporarily suspended and subsequently recommence, Distributions to Investors shall be calculated based on the Snapshots taken during the period of suspension. This applies only if such Snapshots were validly recorded by Issuer in accordance with the clause at reference 3 and ensures that Distribution rights accrued during the suspension are preserved upon recommencement of Revenue Payments.
12. Distributions are made through an on-chain Vault mechanism. Issuer will deposit the relevant Total Distribution into the relevant Vault within 5 Business Days following receipt of the Total Distribution. Investors are responsible for claiming their Distributions by connecting their Wallet to the system Interface, which generates Crypto Receipts and shows amounts available for claim by Investor. Any transaction fees incurred in the course of claiming are borne by Investor.
13. Distributions must be claimed by Investor within a period of three (3) years from the date on which the Distribution was first made available in the on-chain Vault. After this period, any unclaimed amounts may be withdrawn from the Vault and retained by Issuer or a designated third party. The limitation period shall be suspended if Investor was evidently prevented, without fault, from claiming the Distribution. This does not affect Investor's statutory rights in case of technical errors or legal disputes concerning entitlement.
14. If indicated in the Particulars, Management Fees may apply and will be deducted from the Total Distribution before payment to Investors.
15. A summary of the key terms of the:
    1. Framework Revenue Purchase Agreement is the Framework Revenue Purchase Agreement Summary (Schedule 2); and
    2. Revenue Swap Agreement is the Revenue Swap Agreement Summary (Schedule 3).

## 5. Disruption of Royalty Payments

1. Investor's entitlement to future Distributions under a Royalty Token Release may be temporarily suspended, delayed, proportionally reduced or permanently ceased, in whole or in part, if circumstances beyond the control of Issuer materially affect the accrual, calculation or legal enforceability of the underlying Royalty Payments from Royalty Originator to Royalty Provider and / or Revenue Payments from Royalty Provider to Issuer, and / or Total Distributions from Royalty Provider to Issuer. Such circumstances include, but are not limited to:
   1. operational disruptions or technical failure at the Oil Well, including breakdowns or production stoppages;
   2. economic or technical depletion of the Wellbore, including side-tracking, cessation of production or additional capital expenditure by Royalty Originator;
   3. suspension, termination, expiry or non-renewal of the Project Agreement, the Offtake Agreement, the Revenue Swap Agreement or the Government Licence;
   4. failure by Royalty Originator to make Royalty Payments to Royalty Provider, including partial or delayed payments;
   5. breach of contract, non-performance or an Insolvency Event affecting Royalty Originator, Royalty Provider or any other material contractual party;
   6. failure or disruption involving third-party service providers essential to Royalty operations, including subcontractors, payment processors or banking;
   7. governmental action or regulatory intervention (e.g., licence revocation or changes in tax, civil or regulatory frameworks) that make continued performance legally or economically unfeasible;
   8. drastic market developments (e.g., oil price volatility or adverse currency fluctuations) materially affecting Royalty revenue;
   9. transfer or assumption of Royalty Originator's interest under the Project Agreement that materially impacts the performance of the Royalty;
   10. administrative, management or tax costs exceeding the expected value of Royalty Payments;
   11. in the event of Force Majeure; and
   12. security-related events including hacking, fraud, or systemic blockchain vulnerabilities leading to necessary freezing of the Royalty Token functionality or vault access.
2. In such cases, Issuer will inform Investors via the system Interface without undue delay, where feasible, and may apply one or more of the following remedial measures:
   1. temporary suspension of Distributions with the possibility of subsequent catch-up; such catch-up payments shall be made exclusively to those Investors who, according to the Snapshot data, held the relevant Royalty Tokens during the period in which the Revenue Payment is not received by Issuer, in proportion to their Wallet Balance recorded at the relevant Snapshot dates; where the Total Distributions actually received by Issuer for the relevant period is lower than the Total Distribution originally due, the catch-up payments will make up the difference relative to the originally due Total Distribution;
   2. permanent cessation of Distributions, if the underlying Royalty entitlement has definitively ceased or cannot reasonably be expected to resume due to legal, operational or economic reasons;
   3. pro-rata allocation of any alternative settlement or negotiated outcome between Royalty Provider and Royalty Originator to Investors, based on the Wallet Balance recorded for each Investor at the relevant Snapshot dates during the period in which the underlying Revenue Payment is not received by Issuer; if the total amount actually received by Royalty Provider under such settlement or negotiated outcome is lower than the aggregate Total Distribution originally due for that period, the amount allocable to each Investor shall be reduced in the same proportion as the total settlement amount bears to the aggregate originally due Total Distribution;
   4. application of Pending Distributions, if available, to offset temporary shortfalls in Distributions;
   5. resumption of Distributions, if applicable, based on the Snapshot balances recorded during the suspension period, unless otherwise determined in accordance with the Token Terms.
3. Investor acknowledges that the Royalty and consequently any Royalty Payments and Distributions are strictly limited to the revenue generated from the original Wellbore as specified in the relevant Royalty Token Release. If Royalty Originator undertakes new capital expenditures (e.g. sidetracking, drilling of new wells or modifying the existing Wellbore), the Royalty is very unlikely to extend to the resulting new production. In such cases, Royalty Payments under the terms of the existing Revenue Swap Agreement may cease without any entitlement to participate in revenues from future production.

## 6. Termination for Good Cause

1. Ordinary termination rights are excluded.
2. Either Party may terminate the contractual relationship underlying these Token Terms with immediate effect for good cause (extraordinary termination), provided that the terminating Party cannot reasonably be expected to continue the contractual relationship under the given circumstances. A good cause shall be deemed to exist in particular, but not exclusively, in the following cases:
   1. an Insolvency Event relating to Issuer, Royalty Originator or Royalty Provider occurs;
   2. the underlying Revenue Swap Agreement or any other fundamental contractual arrangement essential to the operation and entitlement of the Royalty, such as the Government Licence or the Offtake Agreement, is terminated, expires or becomes legally or factually unenforceable on a permanent basis;
   3. a change in applicable law, tax regulation or regulatory interpretation occurs that makes it legally or economically impossible or unreasonable to continue the Royalty structure or for Issuer to make further Distributions; or
   4. one of the Parties commits a material breach of its contractual obligations and fails to remedy such breach within a reasonable grace period, if applicable, and the non-breaching Party cannot reasonably be expected to continue the contractual relationship.
3. The extraordinary termination must be declared in text form (e.g. via the Interface or email). Termination shall not affect any claims that have already arisen prior to the effective date of termination, particularly any pending or accrued Distributions.

## 7. Issuer Rights |Ref 4|

1. In the event of a Security Event Issuer shall have the right, at its sole and reasonable discretion, to take any of the following remedial measures to protect the integrity of the Royalty Token system, subject to applicable law and with due regard to the interests of Investors:
   1. Issuer may suspend all transactions involving the affected SFT Bucket, including minting, burning and transfers of Tokens, until the risk has been resolved or mitigated. As part of this measure, Issuer may activate a smart contract-based freeze function to technically enforce the suspension of all Royalty Token activity. During the freeze, Investors will not be able to transfer, acquire or otherwise dispose of their Royalty Tokens. The freeze shall be lifted once the relevant risk has been assessed and mitigated.
   2. Issuer may deploy a new SFT Bucket to replace the affected smart contract infrastructure. In this case, Issuer may distribute new replacement Royalty Tokens via airdrop to Investors recorded in a Snapshot prior to the Security Event or establish a swap mechanism allowing Investors to voluntarily exchange old Royalty Tokens for new ones.
   3. To preserve the legal and economic integrity of the Royalty Token system and to avoid unjust enrichment of malicious actors, Issuer shall have the sole and absolute discretion to exclude any Wallets that are, directly or indirectly connected with the Security Event from participating in any Royalty Token airdrop or other remedial measure under this section at reference 4.
   4. This section at reference 4 shall not limit Issuer’s liability for intent, gross negligence or damages resulting from injury to life, body or health. The discretionary powers granted to Issuer herein shall be exercised in good faith and in a manner that is reasonable, transparent and proportionate to the nature of the Security Event.
2. Issuer is entitled to upgrade the functionality of the Royalty Token, in particular to improve security, efficiency or regulatory compliance. For this purpose, Issuer may provide a 1:1 swap mechanism via a smart contract, allowing Investors to voluntarily exchange their existing Royalty Tokens for new Royalty Tokens with updated functionality. The existing rights associated with the Royalty Token shall remain unaffected until the swap is executed such that the terms of the new Royalty Tokens will come into effect between the Parties and the agreement represented by the old Royalty Token will be terminated immediately.
3. Issuer may, upon receipt of a binding and enforceable order issued by a competent legal authority with jurisdiction, confiscate Royalty Tokens held by an Investor if such measure is strictly required to comply with applicable laws or regulations (including but not limited to sanctions, anti-money laundering obligations, or court orders). In such case, the relevant Royalty Tokens may be transferred to a designated wallet specified by the authority or technically restricted (e.g., via freezing or blocking of transfers). Issuer shall notify the affected Investor of the measure and the underlying legal basis without undue delay, unless prohibited by law. If such action is later found to have been erroneous or unlawful, Investor shall be entitled to appropriate restitution or restoration of their Royalty Token holdings, where legally and technically feasible. Any confiscation without legal basis or compensation is expressly excluded. All other rights of Investor under these Token Terms remain unaffected.

## 8. Qualified Subordination

1. In order to avoid over-indebtedness within the meaning of Section 19 (2) of the German Insolvency Act (“**InsO**”) of Issuer and in the event of liquidation proceedings, Investors and Issuer hereby agree, in accordance with Section 39 (2) InsO, to subordinate all current and future claims of Investors under these Token Terms (“**Claims**”) in such a way that the Claims shall only be satisfied after all existing and future claims of creditors of Issuer referred to in Section 39 (1) nos. 1 to 5 InsO have been fully satisfied and only to the extent that such satisfaction does not cause or significantly increase the risk of insolvency or over-indebtedness of Issuer within the meaning of Sections 17 or 19 InsO.
2. Investors may only assert, enforce or demand performance of Claims if Issuer is not currently insolvent or over-indebted within the meaning of Sections 17 or 19 InsO, and only to the extent that such enforcement does not itself result in, or materially increase the risk of, such a state of insolvency or over-indebtedness. Claims that cannot be satisfied from Issuer’s free assets or from other available assets that remain after satisfaction of all non-subordinated creditors shall not become due for the duration of such circumstances. This does not constitute a waiver of the Claims.
3. This qualified subordination constitutes a contract for the benefit of all current and future creditors of Issuer and may not be revoked or amended to their detriment once Issuer is insolvent, over-indebted or subject to the opening of insolvency proceedings.
4. Any payments made in breach of this subordination shall be returned to Issuer. Issuer may enforce such repayment claims in court.
5. All Claims of Investors rank pari passu among themselves.
6. In the event that court decisions or legal provisions require amendments to these Token Terms in order to ensure the validity and enforceability of this subordination clause, particularly to avoid the classification of Issuer as over-indebted within the meaning of applicable insolvency law, such amendments shall be deemed agreed between Investors and Issuer. In this case, the subordinated Claims shall be ranked in accordance with the relative priority required by law or the relevant court decision in order to prevent the Claims from being treated as liabilities on the balance sheet of Issuer. The Parties undertake to promptly adjust the provisions of these Token Terms to the amended legal framework.

## 9. Token Rights and Transfer

1. The Royalty Token does not grant Investor any ownership, co-ownership or property rights in the underlying Royalty, the Revenue Swap Agreement or the associated energy asset. In particular:
   1. the Royalty Token does not represent a fractional ownership interest in any receivable, asset, licence or contractual right held by Issuer or Royalty Originator;
   2. the Royalty Token only confers a contractual right to receive a Distribution, calculated according to the rules and formulas set out in these Token Terms and the applicable Particulars based on Royalty Payments received by Issuer;
   3. the Royalty Token carries no other rights whatsoever, including, but not limited to, voting rights, dividend rights, rights to participate in rights issues or participation in shareholder meetings.
2. Where control over a Royalty Token is transferred by way of crypto token transfer:
   1. the transferring Party shall be deemed to have transferred all rights and obligations associated with that Royalty Token under these Token Terms;
   2. the owner of the transferee Wallet shall automatically become subject to these Token Terms in place of the transferor, without the need for separate consent by Issuer.

## 10. Legal Compliance of Investors

1. Investor represents and warrants that, at the time of acquiring and while holding the Royalty Token, no legal, regulatory, contractual or other restrictions exist under Applicable Law or jurisdiction that would prohibit, restrict or otherwise impair Investor’s right or ability to lawfully acquire, hold or exercise any rights associated with the Royalty Token.
2. Investor further represents and warrants that there are no legal impediments to Investor holding the Royalty Token.
3. Investor agrees that it will not buy, sell or otherwise deal with its Royalty Tokens while in possession of ‘inside information’ for the purposes of the United Kingdom’s Market Abuse Regulation, the EU Market Abuse Regulation, the Criminal Justice Act 1993, United Kingdom or under other applicable legislation which prohibits the dealing in securities when in possession of price-sensitive information (including where such legislation uses different terminology to ‘inside information’), where such information concerns the company to which the Royalty Tokens relate.

## 11. Investor Risks and Limitations

1. Investor bears the risk of any changes in law, regulation or tax regime, particularly the introduction of hydrocarbon-related taxes, that may reduce or eliminate Royalty Payments and, consequently, the Revenue Payments and Distributions derived therefrom. Such changes may occur without prior notice and are beyond the control of Issuer, Royalty Originator or Royalty Provider.
2. Crypto transactions are irreversible. Investors accept the following risks associated with errors:
   1. If a third party (e.g., an external service provider or wallet provider) makes an error, Issuer is not liable for the resulting consequences, provided such third party is not acting as a vicarious agent (Erfüllungsgehilfe) or auxiliary person (Verrichtungsgehilfe) within the meaning of Applicable Law.
   2. If Issuer causes an error, Investor may assert claims in accordance with statutory law and the clause at reference 5 of these Token Terms.
3. Investors who acquire Royalty Tokens on the secondary market acknowledge that prior Distributions may, in rare cases, have been incorrectly calculated due to technical or administrative errors. Such errors may originate from third parties involved in the upstream payment chain, including Royalty Originator, who is not a party to the contractual relationship between Investor and Issuer. If such an error is identified after a Royalty Token has been transferred, Issuer may, to the extent legally permissible and technically feasible, adjust future Distributions to reflect the correct allocation. Such adjustment shall only apply if it does not retroactively reduce legally vested claims and shall not be made if the error was caused by Issuer’s, Royalty Provider’s or Royalty Originator’s intent or gross negligence. Issuer shall inform the affected Investors in a timely, clear, and transparent manner and shall document the reasons and method of correction.
4. If Royalty Provider is required to initiate legal action against Royalty Originator to enforce payment of due Royalty amounts, the following shall apply:
   1. If the enforcement is successful and funds are recovered, whether in full or in part, Royalty Provider is entitled to deduct only those legal costs that are (i) directly related to the enforcement of the Royalty Payments, (ii) objectively necessary and reasonable in amount, and (iii) supported by verifiable documentation. Any recovered amount will be transferred to Issuer for onward Distribution to Investors in accordance with these Token Terms.
   2. If the enforcement is unsuccessful and becomes a Permanent Payment Default, Royalty Provider shall bear all legal costs. Investors shall not suffer any financial disadvantage as a result.
   3. If the enforcement is temporarily unsuccessful but the default has not become a Permanent Payment Default, Royalty Provider may offset the incurred legal costs proportionally against future Royalty Payments or instalment amounts recovered pursuant to an agreed payment schedule between Royalty Provider and Royalty Originator, before forwarding them to Issuer for Distribution to Investors. Such offsets may only occur in the course of ongoing Distributions and may not retroactively affect prior payouts. This clause does not entitle Issuer to claim additional payments from Investors or to recover any previously distributed amounts.
5. Investor shall not be entitled to derive any contractual or quasi-contractual rights or entitlements from, or assert any such rights or entitlements against, Royalty Originator based on the contractual relationship between Royalty Provider and Royalty Originator. In particular, the contractual relationship between Royalty Originator and Royalty Provider shall not give rise to any contractual or quasi-contractual rights or entitlements of Investor.
6. The Royalty Token system operates on blockchain-based infrastructure. Technical malfunctions, software bugs, or security incidents, such as smart contract exploits, oracle failures or consensus-level attacks, may impair or interrupt the functionality of the Royalty Tokens. Issuer cannot guarantee the uninterrupted or error-free performance of blockchain networks or third-party infrastructure that is beyond their control. Issuer shall implement industry-standard security measures to safeguard assets both on-chain and off-chain. Nevertheless, Investors acknowledge that the use of crypto-based payment systems involves certain inherent risks, including but not limited to losses resulting from hacking, fraud, or technical malfunctions outside Issuer’s control. This does not affect Issuer’s liability for damages caused by intent or gross negligence, or for the slightly negligent breach of material contractual obligations (cardinal duties). Further provisions on liability are set out in the clause at reference 5 of these Token Terms.

## 12. Security and the Security Agent |Ref 7|

1. The Secured Claims of Investors shall be secured by the Collateral granted by Issuer and held by the Security Agent under the Collateral Agreement. Upon receipt by the Security Agent of a Notice Of Event Of Default and after a grace period of thirty (30) calendar days has expired and after the Security Agent has verified that an Event Of Default or an Insolvency Event in relation to Issuer has occurred, the Security Agent shall enforce and manage the Collateral for the account (under a true contract for the benefit of third parties) of Investors in accordance with the terms of the Collateral Agreement.
2. The Security Agent shall be entitled, upon the occurrence of an Event Of Default, to enforce directly any assigned claims or enforcement rights against Royalty Provider on behalf of Investors, including by way of legal action or settlement. Issuer shall provide the Security Agent with all necessary documentation and access to information required for enforcement. Royalty Provider shall cooperate with the Security Agent in good faith and may not object to such enforcement on the basis of lacking privity of contract.
3. The Security Agent is not a common representative of Investors within the meaning of the German Debenture Bond Act (_Schuldverschreibungsgesetz_) and it is not liable under the provisions of the German Debenture Bond Act.
4. The Security Agent shall receive from Issuer during the term of the Collateral Agreement an appropriate remuneration as well as reimbursement of its expenses, fees and disbursements incurred in connection with the Collateral Agreement.
5. The Collateral Agreement provides that upon the occurrence of an Event Of Default or an Insolvency Event relating to Issuer the Collateral cannot be realised by Issuer. If none of these events occur, Issuer may access and realise the Collateral.
6. By investing in the Royalty Tokens, each Investor expressly agrees and acknowledges that Issuer shall appoint the Security Agent to act on behalf of Investors for the purpose of holding and enforcing the collateral, as further specified in and subject to the terms and conditions of the Collateral Terms (Schedule 1) of the Collateral Agreement.
7. The Security Agent may, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Collateral Agreement, delegate any of its obligations and functions to a third party, as it deems appropriate.
8. If the Collateral Agreement is terminated prematurely, Issuer is obliged to appoint a new Security Agent. Issuer will announce a change of the Security Agent in accordance with clause at reference 6.

## 13. Information and Disclosures

1. Issuer may, from time to time, provide Investors with information concerning the Royalty Tokens or the Oil Well. Issuer is not obliged to disclose information where Issuer, acting reasonably, considers that such disclosure would breach applicable law, including insider-trading, privacy, or confidentiality obligations, or other regulatory restrictions.
2. Information originating from third parties is provided to Investors for informational purposes only. Issuer does not independently verify such information and assumes responsibility for it only if Issuer knew or should reasonably have known that the information was incorrect or misleading.
3. Issuer will disclose data received from Royalty Originator by way of Royalty Provider regarding the Oil Well, once such data becomes publicly available.
4. Before disclosing to Investors data received from Royalty Originator regarding the Oil Well, Issuer may repackage or amend the data, or omit certain details from it, as reasonably determined by Issuer, provided such repackaging, amendment or omission does not render the data inaccurate or misleading.
5. Issuer is not obliged to disclose any information received from Royalty Originator to Investors where Issuer considers in good faith that:
   1. such information constitutes or may constitute ‘inside information’ for the purposes of the United Kingdom’s Market Abuse Regulation, the EU Market Abuse Regulation, the Criminal Justice Act 1993, United Kingdom or under other applicable legislation (including where such legislation uses different terminology to ‘inside information’); or
   2. disclosure of the information may breach applicable law (including laws concerning privacy or the distribution of competitively sensitive information) or an obligation of confidentiality owed to a third party.
6. Nothing in this section shall limit or exclude Issuer’s liability for injury to life, body, or health, or for damages caused by intent or gross negligence, or affect mandatory statutory liability.

## 14. Liability |Ref 5|

1. Issuer shall be liable without limitation only for damages suffered by Investor that:
   1. are caused by an intentional or grossly negligent breach of duty by Issuer its legal representatives or vicarious agents; or
   2. result from the slightly negligent breach of a material contractual obligation (cardinal duty). In this case, Issuer’s liability shall be limited to the foreseeable damage typical for the type of contract. Cardinal duties are obligations whose fulfilment is essential for the proper execution of the Token Terms and on which Investor regularly relies.
2. Issuer shall not be liable for defects, malfunctions or failures of any blockchain, smart contracts or other technical infrastructure operated by third parties beyond their control. This includes, in particular, losses due to errors, delays, or interruptions in blockchain-based transactions. Issuer shall also not be liable for the loss of off-chain assets or on-chain tokens, unless such loss was caused by intentional misconduct or gross negligence. Liability for data loss is limited to typical recovery costs that would have been incurred with appropriate, risk-based data backup.
3. Any further liability of Issuer is excluded to the extent permitted by law. This limitation also applies to the personal liability of their employees, representatives and vicarious agents, including liability in tort.
4. The above exclusions and limitations of liability shall not apply in cases of injury to life, body or health, in the event of liability under mandatory statutory provisions, particularly the German Product Liability Act (_Produkthaftungsgesetz_) or where a guarantee to Investor has been expressly assumed.
5. The limitation period for all warranty claims of Investor shall be twelve (12) months, unless longer periods are required by mandatory law. This does not apply if Investor is a consumer within the meaning of § 13 BGB; in such cases, the statutory limitation periods shall remain unaffected.

## 15. Force Majeure

1. In case of an unforeseen, extraordinary event due to which Issuer is partly or entirely prevented from the fulfilment of its obligations, i.e. due to war or civil commotion, riots, industrial actions (e.g. strike, lockout), pandemics, as well as interruptions of operations, acts of god (e.g. flood, earthquake, fire) or seizures, embargos and other official orders such as export licenses not granted, ordered limitations of energy consumption or due to Brexit (“**Force Majeure**”), Issuer shall be exempted from their obligation to supply for the duration of the Force Majeure event and the delivery period shall be extended accordingly.
2. Issuer is obliged to notify Investor of the occurrence and end of the Force Majeure event.
3. If it appears likely that the Force Majeure event will last for at least 90 days, Investor is entitled to terminate the contractual relationship underlying these Token Terms for good cause.
4. In case of Force Majeure, Issuer shall not be liable for non-performance or delays, except in cases of gross negligence, wilful misconduct, or injury to life, body or health.

## 16. Substitution of Issuer

Each Issuer may, without the prior consent of Investors, substitute themselves in relation to all rights and obligations under these Token Terms with another legal entity (the “New Issuer”), provided that:

1. the New Issuer is objectively capable of performing all obligations arising from or in connection with these Token Terms;
2. the existing Issuer provides an irrevocable and unconditional guarantee to Investors for the full and timely performance of the New Issuer’s obligations under these Token Terms;
3. such substitution does not materially impair the legal position of Investors, in particular with regard to:
   1. the enforceability of rights under these Token Terms,
   2. the applicable regulatory protections, and
   3. Investor's ability to receive Distributions.

Investors shall be informed of any substitution without undue delay through the communication procedure set out in the clause at reference 6.

## 17. Amendments of the Token Terms

1. Issuer shall be entitled to amend or supplement the Token Terms without the prior consent of Investors, provided that such amendment or supplementation:
   1. is necessary to correct manifest clerical or factual errors;
   2. serves to clarify ambiguous or unclear provisions without changing the substantive rights or obligations of Investors; or
   3. is necessary to adapt to technical, legal, or regulatory developments, provided such change does not materially prejudice Investor’s legal or financial position and is transparently communicated. Issuer shall provide reasons for such an amendment; or
   4. is required by binding legal provisions, final judicial decisions, or binding administrative orders.
2. If the amendment affects material provisions of the Token Terms, including rights, obligations, or the economic position of Investors, such amendment shall only take effect if Investor has expressly agreed to the amendment in advance. Issuer shall provide Investor with the proposed amendment in text form, explaining the reasons for the change. Issuer may ask Investor to provide consent electronically or in writing. If Investor does not consent, the existing Token Terms shall continue to apply. Issuer reserves the right to terminate the agreement with six (6) weeks’ notice, provided that continuation of the agreement would be unreasonable for Issuer. In cases where Investor refuses to consent to a material amendment pursuant to this section, Issuer may offer to redeem the affected Royalty Tokens at their fair market value in USDT, provided the redemption terms are transparent, objectively verifiable and not disadvantageous to Investors. Redemption shall be made to Investor’s last known wallet address.
3. For the avoidance of doubt, the version of the Token Terms applicable to a specific Royalty Token Release shall be the version in force at the time of that Royalty Token Release.

### 3. Security Assignment

Issuer hereby transfers any Collateral by way of security to the Security Agent and assigns any of its claims and enforcement rights against Royalty Provider for payment of Total Distributions to the Security Agent as security in order to secure the Secured Claims.

### 4. Enforcement

1. By acquiring the Royalty Token, each Investor declares to the Security Agent that they wish to enforce their rights under this Agreement when a Notice Of Event Of Default is in effect.
2. With first priority, the Security Agent shall be entitled to satisfy its claims against Issuer under this Agreement or any similar agreement, as the case may be (including fee claims) from the realization proceeds before any other payments are made.
3. Furthermore, on a pari passu basis in or towards payment of all amounts due and unpaid and all obligations due to be performed in respect of the relevant Secured Claims for which the Collateral is being realized, any other third parties' claims in connection with any realization and distribution costs shall be satisfied and the Security Agent may also deduct these additional costs from the realization proceeds, before any other payments are made to Investors; the remaining realization proceeds shall be available for payment to Investors ("**Net Realization Proceeds**").
4. The Security Agent shall distribute the Net Realization Proceeds with discharging effect by paying the pro-rata share of the Net Realization Proceeds to the respective Investor. The transfer of the pro-rata shares of the Net Realization Proceeds shall be determined by the holdings of the number of Royalty Tokens in circulation for the relevant Royalty Token Release at the time of the applicable Snapshot.
5. The Security Agent may refuse to transfer any Net Realization Proceeds to the respective Investor and the claim of Investor lapses if Investor is not providing additional information requested by the Security Agent.
6. No interest shall be paid on the Secured Claims of Investor, which correspond to their pro-rata shares of the Net Realization Proceeds realized from the Collateral. The Security Agent shall not owe any default interest to Investors on the payment of the pro-rata share of Net Realization Proceeds, neither shall the Security Agent be liable to Investors for any further damages whatsoever.
7. The payment of pro-rata Net Realization Proceeds to Investors under the terms of this Agreement, discharges the Secured Claims of Investor (represented by the Security Agent) against Issuer that are secured by the Collateral.

### 5. Limitation of Liability

Unless otherwise stated in this Agreement, both Parties shall only be liable to each other for damages resulting from a breach of contractual obligations if such damages were caused by wilful misconduct or gross negligence. Liability for slight negligence is excluded, except in cases of breach of fundamental contractual obligations ("cardinal obligations") by Issuer. Cardinal obligations are those which are essential to the proper performance of the contract and on which the other party relies and may reasonably rely. In the event of a breach of cardinal obligations due to slight negligence, Issuer's responsibility shall be limited to foreseeable, typically occurring damages.
2. Neither Party shall be liable for damages caused by actions or omissions of third parties, including but not limited to subcontractors, unless such third-party actions are directly attributable to the negligence or wilful misconduct of the party seeking to disclaim liability.
3. In no event shall the Security Agent be liable for any action or failure to act of Issuer under this Agreement or any applicable statutory or regulatory requirement.
4. In no event shall the Security Agent be liable for punitive, special, indirect or consequential losses or damages (including lost profits), whether or not foreseeable, even if the Security Agent has been advised of the possibility thereof and regardless of the form of action in which such damages are sought.
5. The Security Agent shall not be liable for any action it takes or omits to take in good faith which it believes to be authorized or within its rights or powers; provided, however, that the Security Agent's conduct does not constitute wilful misconduct.
6. The aforementioned limitations and exclusions of liability shall not apply in cases of mandatory statutory liability or in cases of injury to life, body, or health.

### 6. Limited Recourse

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no recourse (whether by institution or enforcement of any legal proceeding or assessment or otherwise) in respect of any breaches of any duty, obligation or undertaking of Issuer arising under or in connection with the Royalty Tokens (as from time to time supplemented or modified in accordance with the provisions herein contained) by virtue of any law, statute or otherwise shall be held against any shareholder, officer, manager or corporate services provider of Issuer in their capacity as such, save in the case of their gross negligence, wilful default or actual fraud, and any and all personal liability of every such shareholder, officer, manager of corporate services provider in their capacity as such for any breaches by Issuer of any such duty, obligation or undertaking shall be waived and excluded to the extent permitted by law. This provision shall survive the redemption and burning of the Tokens.

### 7. Replacement of Security Agent

1. The Security Agent may resign at any time by notifying Issuer in writing not less than ninety (90) days prior to the effective date of such resignation. Issuer shall remove the Security Agent if:
   1. the Security Agent fails to comply with its obligations;
   2. the Security Agent is adjudged as bankrupt or insolvent;
   3. a receiver or other public officer takes charge of the Security Agent or its property; or
   4. the Security Agent otherwise becomes incapable of acting.
2. If the Security Agent resigns or is removed for any reason, Issuer shall promptly appoint a successor Security Agent.
3. Any successor Security Agent shall deliver a written acceptance of its appointment to the retiring Security Agent and to Issuer.

2. The place of performance and sole legal venue for all disputes arising from the legal relationships regulated under this Collateral Agreement is Berlin.
3. No waiver or variation of any part of this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing. No waiver of any provision in this Agreement will be deemed a waiver of a subsequent breach of such provision or a waiver of a similar provision. In addition, a waiver of any breach or a failure to enforce any term or condition of this Agreement will not in any way affect, limit, or waive our rights hereunder at any time to enforce strict compliance thereafter with every term and condition of this Agreement.
4. If any provision of this Agreement should be or become invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part, this shall indisputably (_unwiderlegbar_) not affect the validity of the balance of this Agreement. The invalid or unenforceable provision shall be deemed replaced by such provision which best meets the intent and the economic purpose of the invalid or unenforceable provision.
